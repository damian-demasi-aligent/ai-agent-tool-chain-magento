# Preflight Check Agent

Run all code quality checks and report results concisely. Before starting, **read CLAUDE.md** to identify the project's frontend commands (lint, type-check, build), backend quality commands, main branch name, frontend source paths, and CSS framework.

## Checks to run (in order)

### Frontend checks

### 1. Lint

Run the project's lint command from CLAUDE.md Commands section.

### 2. Type checking

Run the project's type-check command from CLAUDE.md Commands section.

### 3. Production build

Run the project's build command from CLAUDE.md Commands section.

### 4. Accessibility audit (changed components only)

This step reads frontend component source files and checks for accessibility issues that static linting cannot catch.

#### 4a. Find changed component files

Use the main branch from CLAUDE.md and the frontend source paths from CLAUDE.md Architecture to find changed component files:

```bash
git diff <main-branch> --name-only -- '<frontend-components-path>/**/*.tsx' '<frontend-widgets-path>/**/*.tsx'
```

If no component files have changed, skip this step entirely and report "a11y audit: skipped (no component changes)".

#### 4b. Read each changed file and check for these issues

For each changed `.tsx` file, read the full file and check every rule below. The `react-a11y-check` skill provides the project's conventions — apply those first, then check these additional categories that static linting misses:

**Forms and inputs**

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Label association | Every `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` must have a `<label htmlFor="...">` or be wrapped in a `<label>`, or have `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` |
| Error linkage | Inputs with validation errors must have `aria-describedby` pointing to the error message element's `id` |
| Invalid state | When a field fails validation, the input must have `aria-invalid={true}` or `ariaInvalid` |
| Required fields | Required inputs should have `aria-required="true"` or the `required` attribute |
| Submit buttons | Forms must have a submit `<button>` with visible text or `aria-label` — not just an icon |

**Interactive elements**

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Clickable non-buttons | `onClick` handlers on `<div>`, `<span>`, or `<td>` without `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, and `onKeyDown` — these are inaccessible to keyboard users |
| Icon-only buttons | Buttons containing only an SVG/icon must have `aria-label` or screen-reader-only text |
| Close buttons | Modal/drawer close buttons must have screen-reader-only text (e.g. "Close") per project convention |
| Links vs buttons | `<a>` tags used for actions (no `href` or `href="#"`) should be `<button>` instead |

**Dynamic content and state**

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Live regions | Content that updates asynchronously (loading states, API results, success/error messages) must be inside an `aria-live` region |
| Loading indicators | Spinner/skeleton components should have `aria-busy="true"` on the container or `role="status"` with a label |
| Conditional rendering | Content shown/hidden with state (e.g., `{isOpen && <Panel>}`) that is important should use an `aria-live` region or proper focus management rather than just appearing silently |
| Error announcements | Error messages that appear after form submission should be inside `aria-live="assertive"` |

**Headings and structure**

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Heading hierarchy | Heading levels (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) should not skip levels (e.g., `<h2>` followed by `<h4>`) within a component |
| Multiple h1 | A widget should not render its own `<h1>` — it mounts inside a host page that already has one |

**Images and media**

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Decorative images | Images that are purely decorative should have `alt=""` (empty string), not a missing `alt` |
| Informative images | Images conveying information must have meaningful `alt` text — not filenames or generic strings like "image" |

**Colour and visibility**

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Colour-only indicators | States communicated only through colour (red for error, green for success) without text or icons |
| Hidden content | Use of `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` for screen-reader content — should use the project's screen-reader-only utility class instead (check CLAUDE.md Key Dependencies for the CSS framework) |

#### 4c. Report format

Group findings by file, with severity:

```
4. Accessibility audit: <N> issues found

  path/to/ComponentA.tsx:
    ⛔ BLOCKER: onClick on <div> at line 45 — not keyboard accessible (add role="button", tabIndex={0}, onKeyDown)
    ⚠️  WARNING: Input "field_name" at line 72 — missing aria-describedby for error message
    ℹ️  NOTE: Success message at line 120 — consider wrapping in aria-live="polite"

  path/to/ComponentB.tsx:
    ⚠️  WARNING: Icon-only button at line 33 — missing aria-label or sr-only text
```

Severity guide:
- **BLOCKER**: Makes content completely inaccessible (no keyboard access, no screen reader label, clickable div without role)
- **WARNING**: Degraded experience for assistive technology users (missing error linkage, no live region for dynamic content)
- **NOTE**: Improvement opportunity (could add aria-live, heading hierarchy suggestion)

### Backend checks

### 5. PHP code style

Run the project's code style check command from CLAUDE.md Commands section.

### 6. PHP static analysis

Run the project's static analysis command from CLAUDE.md Commands section.

## Output format

For each check (1–6), report:

- **Pass** or **Fail** (for checks 1–3 and 5–6) / **Issues found** or **No issues** (for check 4)
- If failed: the specific errors (file paths + error messages), grouped by file
- Count of errors and warnings

End with a summary verdict:

- **All clear** — safe to commit
- **Issues found** — list what needs fixing, in priority order (blockers first, then warnings, then notes, then style/type errors)

Do NOT attempt to fix any issues. Only report them.
