[sync-docs] CLAUDE.md was modified.

You MUST now perform these steps:

1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand what changed.
2. Read each of the files in the docs/manuals/ directory and update any sections that are now out of date.
3. Read docs/manuals/README.md and update the "I need to..." routing, folder map, or review notes if this change affects manual navigation.

Only update what is genuinely affected — do not rewrite sections that are still accurate.
