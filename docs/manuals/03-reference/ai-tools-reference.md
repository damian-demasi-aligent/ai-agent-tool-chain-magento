## Agents

Agents are autonomous subprocesses invoked with `@agent-name`. They run independently, read files, and return a single result to the conversation.

| Agent | Invoke | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `codebase-qa` | `@codebase-qa [question]` | Answer "how does X work" questions by reading the actual source. Returns file paths and line references. |
| `committer` | `@committer` | Analyse uncommitted changes, propose a logical commit breakdown, and execute after approval. [Two-phase workflow.](#committer) |
| `documenter` | `@documenter [TICKET-XXX]` | Generate a feature architecture document (`docs/features/`) from the code on the current branch. Includes Mermaid diagrams, data flows, and deployment steps. |
| `feature-implementer` | `@feature-implementer [plan or task]` | Write code across PHP and React layers following project conventions. Runs in an isolated worktree. Produces a change summary with verification results. Best used via `/implement-feature` which also orchestrates the code review. |
| `feature-planner` | `@feature-planner [feature description]` | Produce a file-by-file implementation plan from requirements and optional pre-researched findings. Best used via `/plan-feature` which provides research automatically. |
| `impact-analyser` | `@impact-analyser [file, type, or description]` | Trace all dependencies of a target and report what else will need to change. |
| `preflight` | `@preflight` | Run full preflight across React and PHP: ESLint, TypeScript, Vite build, focused a11y audit, PHPCS, and PHPStan. Report results only — never modifies files. |
| `reviewer` | `@reviewer` | Review the current branch diff against `production`. Returns per-file issues with severity and a merge verdict. |
| `test-runner` | `@test-runner [scope?]` | Run the Vitest test suite and report results. Accepts a component name, file path, or `changed` to run only tests for changed files. Guides setup if test infrastructure is missing. |

### `committer` — two-phase workflow

Phase 1 (default — invoke with no arguments):
```
@committer
```
Returns a proposed commit plan. Does not create any commits.

Phase 2 (execute the approved plan):
After reviewing the plan in the conversation, reply `"go"` — the main Claude will invoke the committer again to execute.

## Skills

Skills are invoked with `/skill-name` in the conversation. They run in the current context and can ask clarifying questions mid-execution. Some skills are also loaded automatically by agents as context modules.

### User-invocable skills

#### Exploration

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/module-overview [ModuleName]` | Concise summary of a custom Magento module: files, purpose, integrations, GraphQL extensions. |
| `/layout-diff [handle or module]` | Compare a theme layout override against the vendor original. Explains what changed and flags maintainability risks. |

#### Feature planning

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/plan-feature [requirements file, ticket, or description]` | Orchestrate the full planning workflow: spawn `codebase-qa` sub-agents for research + `impact-analyser` sub-agents for ripple effects, then delegate to `@feature-planner` with findings. Returns a file-by-file implementation plan. |
| `/implement-feature [plan file path]` | Orchestrate the full implementation workflow: validate the plan, spawn `@feature-implementer` in an isolated worktree, then spawn `@reviewer` to review the result. Returns a combined report with change summary, verification results, and code review findings. The review feedback is informational output for the user — it does not trigger automated fixes. |

#### Feature scaffolding

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/react-new-widget [name]` | Create a new Vite widget entry point and component directory. Confirms Magento integration before creating PHP files. |
| `/react-form-wizard [name]` | Scaffold a multi-step form wizard following the project's existing form patterns (see CLAUDE.md Reuse table). |
| `/gql [name]` | Scaffold a GraphQL operation. Auto-detects whether the PHP schema exists — if not, creates schema + resolver + React data layer; if so, creates React data layer only. |
| `/plugin [ClassName::method]` | Create a Magento 2 plugin (interceptor). Reads vendor class, determines correct plugin type. |
| `/observer [event_name — description]` | Create a Magento 2 observer. Finds the event dispatch in vendor, determines scope, creates Observer class + `events.xml` registration. |
| `/create-theme-override [Module/path]` | Copy a vendor template or layout file to the project's theme override directory (from CLAUDE.md). Shows original before modifying. |
| `/react-dom-hook [name]` | Create a MutationObserver hook for bridging Magento's vanilla JS DOM changes into React state. |
| `/admin-config [description]` | Scaffold admin configuration: `system.xml` fields, `config.xml` defaults, source models, dynamic row blocks, and ACL resources. Shows plan before writing. |
| `/data-patch [description]` | Create declarative schema (`db_schema.xml`) or data patches (EAV attributes, DB operations). Supports product/customer attributes, table columns, and new tables. |
| `/email-template [description]` | Scaffold transactional email: `email_templates.xml`, HTML templates (customer + internal), PHP sender methods, and branch routing. |

#### Quality

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/preflight [react\|php]` | Run quality checks — `react` for frontend (ESLint + TypeScript + Vite build), `php` for backend (PHPCS + PHPStan), or omit for both. |
| `/react-add-tests [target or "setup"]` | Write Vitest tests for a component, hook, or provider. Use `"setup"` to bootstrap test infrastructure. |
| `/react-sync-types [module?]` | Compare `schema.graphqls` definitions against the project's TypeScript types file and GQL template literals (paths from CLAUDE.md). Reports mismatches. |
| `/react-debug-widget [name]` | Trace the full integration chain for a React widget and identify the broken link. |

#### Git

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/commit-pr` | Interactive commit workflow: analyse changes, propose plan, wait for approval, execute commits. |
| `/review-pr [PR#/branch]` | Review a PR or branch diff with project-specific checklist (conventions from CLAUDE.md). |

### Agent context skills (not user-invocable)

These are loaded automatically into agents that declare them. They inject project conventions and patterns into the agent's context.

| Skill | Loaded by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `less-theme` | `feature-implementer` | LESS and CSS theming conventions for the Magento theme (reads paths from CLAUDE.md). |
| `magento-module` | `feature-implementer`, `feature-planner`, `committer`, `reviewer`, `documenter` | Magento 2 module structure and PHP conventions. |
| `react-a11y-check` | `feature-implementer`, `reviewer`, `preflight` | Accessibility patterns: forms, dialogs, dynamic content, error states. |
| `react-error-handling` | `feature-implementer`, `feature-planner`, `reviewer` | `ActionResult<T>` pattern, Zod `safeParse`, error display. |
| `react-patterns` | `feature-implementer`, `feature-planner`, `committer`, `reviewer`, `documenter`, `test-runner` | React component conventions, state, DOM integration, styling. |
| `react-widget-wiring` | `feature-implementer`, `feature-planner`, `reviewer`, `documenter` | `data-react-widget` mounting, data attributes, script loading. |
| `email-patterns` | `feature-implementer`, `feature-planner`, `reviewer` | TransportBuilder patterns, email_templates.xml, HTML template directives, branch routing. |
| `rest-api-patterns` | `feature-implementer`, `feature-planner`, `reviewer` | `webapi.xml` routes, service contract interfaces, Data DTOs, di.xml preferences, REST vs GraphQL decision guide. |

## Claude Hooks Automation

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and run automatically before or after certain tool calls.

### Shared configuration

Project-specific paths (vendor namespace, React source root, build output directories, GraphQL layer paths) are centralised in **`.claude/hooks/config.sh`**. Each hook that needs project-specific paths sources this file automatically — no manual setup required. When reusing this `.claude/` directory in another project, edit `config.sh` to match the new project's directory structure.

### Hook inventory

| Hook | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `config.sh` | Sourced by other hooks | Exports project-specific path variables (`VENDOR_NAMESPACE`, `REACT_SRC`, `REACT_BUILD_JS`, etc.). Not a hook itself — it is a shared config file. |
| `core-vendor-guard.sh` | `PreToolUse` on `Write or Edit` | Blocks edits to Magento core and vendor files and instructs extension-safe alternatives. |
| `clean-build-output.sh` | `PreToolUse` on `Bash` (`git commit`) | Removes and unstages React build output (`web/js`, `web/css`) before commit. Uses paths from `config.sh`. |
| `graphql-sync-check.sh` | `PreToolUse` on `Bash` (`git commit`) | Blocks commit when GraphQL schema, GQL templates, and TS types are not staged consistently. Uses paths from `config.sh`. |
| `sync-manuals-check.sh` | `PostToolUse` on `Write or Edit` | Prompts manual updates when `.claude/*` tooling files or `CLAUDE.md` change. |
| `react-lint-on-edit.sh` | `PostToolUse` on `Write or Edit` | For edited React source files, runs `yarn eslint --fix` then `yarn eslint` on the edited file. Uses paths from `config.sh`. |
